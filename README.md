# gul-zoe

An assistant bot for the gul.es non-profit organization. 

Zoe performs repetitive, boring and time-consuming tasks that no one want to do.



# How it works

Zoe is basically a bunch of agents interchanging messages asynchronously. 
Each agent performs a few, small and well defined tasks like capturing 
statistics from the organization systems, sending emails, generating reports 
and controlling alarms. 

Zoe can also receive commands from the system administrators to execute tasks
on demand.

# Where Do I start

In the doc/ directory you will find documentation of 

1- the Zoe protocol, which is really simple
2- the messages the agents accept
3- the process of executing administrator commands in natural language

You should start reading the first section and having a look at the message
definitions. It will take less than 5 minutes. There are some well documented 
example agents in:

    src/zoe/agents/example.py     (in Python)
    src_java/echoAgent            (in java)

Most of the agents are written in Python so you can take a look at their 
source code in 

    src/zoe/agents

The log and user agents are a good starting point because of their simplicity.

If you prefer Java, take a look at

    src_java/twitterAgent

and focus in the AnnotatedEchoAgent.java example.
